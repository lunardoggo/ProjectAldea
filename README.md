# ProjectAldea
Space for testing fun stuff in Unity3D that maybe will evolve into a game ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Some stuff I'm currently experimenting with:
  * Terrain generation using compute shaders written in HLSL
  * Unity DOTS and ECS for simulating RTS units
  * Modding system that allows for assets to be loaded from the disk at runtime (for example for faction info)
  * I18N system for translating UI at runtime
